# Plant Disease Recognition System

This project is a web-based application for detecting plant diseases using a trained TensorFlow model. The system allows users to upload an image of a plant, analyze it, and identify potential diseases. It is built using Streamlit for the front-end interface and TensorFlow for the machine learning model.

## Installation

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
- Numpy
- Pandas

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit tensorflow pandas numpy
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/offline-keshav/Plant_Disease_Prediction_ML_Model
cd Plant_Disease_Prediction_ML_Model
```

### Model File

The trained model should be placed in the root directory of the project. Ensure the file is named `trained_model.keras`. 

## Usage

To run the Plant Disease Recognition System, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

After launching, the application will be accessible in your web browser.

### Sidebar Options

- **Home:** Displays a brief overview of the project, along with a description of how to use the system.
- **About:** Contains information about the dataset used to train the model.
- **Disease Recognition:** This is where you can upload an image of a plant leaf for disease detection.

### Disease Recognition

1. Navigate to the **Disease Recognition** page.
2. Upload an image of the plantâ€™s leaf.
3. Click the "Show Image" button to display the uploaded image.
4. Click the "Predict" button to let the model analyze the image and display the predicted disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model consists of 87,000+ RGB images of plant leaves categorized into 38 different classes, representing both healthy and diseased plants. It is split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets. A small test dataset (33 images) is also used for predictions.

### Dataset Structure:

- **Train:** 70,295 images
- **Test:** 33 images
- **Validation:** 17,572 images

## How It Works

The application takes an image input, processes it using the pre-trained TensorFlow model, and predicts the class of the plant disease. The predictions are based on a classification of 38 different diseases.
